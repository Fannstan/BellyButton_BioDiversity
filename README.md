# BellyButton_Biodiversity

## Overview: 
Improbable Beef is researching whether a species of belly button bacteria can be used in the manufacturing of synthetic beef.  The interactive dashboard created in this project will enable study volunteers to view the top 10 bacterial species contained in their navels.  If Imporbably Beef identifies a specific bacterial species, the study participants will be able to use this dashboard to determine if their navel contains this specific bacterial species. 

## Results: 
Study participants can select their specific Test Subject ID # by using a Drop Down Menu.  The menu displays the subject's Demographic Information, it then shows a horizontal bar chart displaying the subject's Top 10 Bacteria Cultures Found, the subject will also see a gauge of their belly button washing frequency, and a bubble chart giving a visual display of the Bacteria Cultures per Sample.
